    <h1>Daubechie Wavelet</h1> <p>-based on the work of Ingrid Daubechies,
    are a family of orthogonal wavelets defining a discrete wavelet transform
    and characterized by a maximal number of vanishing moments for some given support.
    With each wavelet type of this class, there is a scaling function (called the father wavelet)
    which generates an orthogonal multiresolution analysis.

      The Daubechie wavelet in time domain is represented in the following figure.
